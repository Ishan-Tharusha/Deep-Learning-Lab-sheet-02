1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

	Adding more hidden nodes helps the network understand more complex patterns. Too few nodes make it hard to learn properly, 
	while too many can make it memorize the data instead of learning generally.

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase? 

	Accuracy improves as we add more nodes at first, then stops increasing much. Adding too many nodes might not help and can sometimes make performance worse.
